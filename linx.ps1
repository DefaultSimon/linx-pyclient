## Proxy for the python script
# If you prefer this, you can add linx.ps1 to your PATH and execute it with any
# arguments as if you were calling the script directly

# Move into the script directory
Set-Location $PSScriptRoot

# Run the script inside a poetry shell
poetry run python linx.py $($args -join " ")
